"I am personally interested, and given the number of questions asked on this subject versus the number of informative posts/articles written about it that actually have substance to them, I'd say do it.
I think the least-written-about points on getting a webdev position are based on comfort levels with various technologies. Most people writing about it say something along the lines of "Fake it till you make it", "You'll never know when you're ready, just do it" when most people reading those articles are looking for "The projects on my github when I was hired exhibited that I could perform ______ at ______ level. My main selling point was that I was able to explain ______ process, why ______ worked, etc."
tl;dr: Please write about it if you are not going to write the same article that has been written over and over again, I am sure a lot of us would appreciate the information!"

"sure! it'd be cool to hear about how much you had to know before you had an offer. like did you just have to know html/css/javascript/php/mysql? Or were you required to be familiar with all their frameworks and technologies? Also, how much training were you given on-site, etc. these are some questions i had"
